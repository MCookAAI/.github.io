I'm currently studying at Level 5 (second year) for a BSc in Applied Artificial Intelligence at the University of Gloucestershire.

A pdf copy of my CV is available <!--[here](/Martin-Cook_Rev.pdf)-->

<py-script>
              from datetime import datetime
              now = datetime.now()
              display(now.strftime("%m/%d/%Y, %H:%M:%S"))
</py-script>
